Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

UI-LAYOUT is a collection of reusable components, each with a bunch of examples in different styles that can be used in various positions.
**I wondered how users would enjoy the journey of scrolling through a website if they didn't feel there was something special about it.**

##### Installation

You must install `tailwindcss`. As most of our components use `framer-motion` install it too.

```bash
npm install framer-motion clsx tailwind-merge
```

Must Add it in the `utils.ts`:

```tsx utils.tsx
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

use this hooks for mediaQueries:

```tsx use-media-query.tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export function useMediaQuery(query: string) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    function onChange(event: MediaQueryListEvent) {
      setValue(event.matches);
    }

    const result = matchMedia(query);
    result.addEventListener('change', onChange);
    setValue(result.matches);

    return () => result.removeEventListener('change', onChange);
  }, [query]);

  return value;
}
```

##### Motivation

The main reason for **creating this component was to help myself.** I've been creating web pages for the last couple of years and love building websites that are reactive and user-friendly. Some components are really reusable for different websites, and I have to search through files to find the code and it's really annoying. So, I thought, what if I create something where all of my animations or components will be in one place?

I gained hope and belief after seeing component libraries like https://ui.shadcn.com and https://ui.aceternity.com I want to give them credit for encouraging me to create free components library like this.

I want to thank https://magicui.design and https://x.com/jakubkrehel for what they have done. When I first completed some components, I realized that I needed to make text animations. Then I discovered **MagicUI** already have done it, and they had a bunch of components that I wanted to create myself.
