  typography:
    'Favor editorial headings with short line lengths, neutral body copy, and tiny metadata where the story needs evidence. The source’s concrete type anchors are `font-manrope`, `font-serif`, `text-2xl`, `text-sm`, `font-medium`, `text-6xl`, `font-bold`, `text-xl`, `leading-relaxed`, `font-semibold`.',
  palette:
    'The implementation anchors its palette with `bg-neutral-100`, `bg-gray-200`, `text-gray-800`, `bg-gray-400`, `text-gray-500`, `text-gray-900`, `text-gray-600`, `bg-violet-600`, `bg-violet-700`, `text-white`. Preserve their roles—canvas, surface, foreground, muted copy, accent and glow—rather than treating them as interchangeable swatches. Do not expand the palette with unrelated accents.',

    'Carry the **Playful portrait cards** into at least one meaningful focal area; reproduce its layer recipe rather than substituting a generic gradient.',
    'Reuse the same accent-to-neutral ratio, image treatment, corner language, and density so adjacent sections read as one system.',
