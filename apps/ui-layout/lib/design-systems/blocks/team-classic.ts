    'Floating profile note defines the identity. The section should feel purposeful and visually specific; new sections should inherit its visual mechanism, not merely its colors.',
  typography:
    'Use a strong team heading, readable names, muted roles, and 10–12px metadata only for tags/status. The source’s concrete type anchors are `text-5xl`, `font-cursive`, `text-sm`, `tracking-wide`, `text-xl`, `font-bold`, `tracking-wider`, `font-spaceGrotesk`, `font-medium`, `text-xs`.',
  palette:
    'The implementation anchors its palette with `bg-[#FFF0F5]`, `text-neutral-800`, `text-neutral-500`, `bg-white`, `text-green-500`, `text-black`. Preserve their roles—canvas, surface, foreground, muted copy, accent and glow—rather than treating them as interchangeable swatches. Do not expand the palette with unrelated accents.',
  composition:
    'Use a responsive portrait grid with consistent card aspect ratios; hover overlays must remain reachable without covering names.',

  extensionRules: [
    'Carry the **Floating profile note** into at least one meaningful focal area; reproduce its layer recipe rather than substituting a generic gradient.',
    'Reuse the same accent-to-neutral ratio, image treatment, corner language, and density so adjacent sections read as one system.',
