  personality:
    'Deep-blue vision window defines the identity. The section should feel purposeful and visually specific; new sections should inherit its visual mechanism, not merely its colors.',
  typography:
    'Favor editorial headings with short line lengths, neutral body copy, and tiny metadata where the story needs evidence. The source’s concrete type anchors are `font-dmSans`, `text-5xl`, `font-bold`, `tracking-tight`, `text-xs`, `font-medium`, `tracking-widest`, `text-sm`, `leading-relaxed`, `text-4xl`.',
  palette:
    'The implementation anchors its palette with `bg-white`, `text-black`, `bg-black/60`, `text-white`, `text-zinc-300`, `text-blue-500`, `bg-blue-50`, `text-blue-950`, `bg-blue-800`, `text-white/70`. Preserve their roles—canvas, surface, foreground, muted copy, accent and glow—rather than treating them as interchangeable swatches. Do not expand the palette with unrelated accents.',
  composition:
    'Alternate narrative copy and art-directed imagery; use asymmetry or bento spans intentionally, then stack in reading order on mobile.',

  buttons:
    'Use one decisive filled CTA and a lower-emphasis text/outline action; buttons should never compete with imagery.',
  interactions:
    'Stagger story elements gently; image reveals and hover states should feel editorial rather than app-like.',
  imagery:
    'Use documentary portraits, work samples, or brand proof; preserve the source crop and color-to-grayscale behavior.',
  extensionRules: [
    'Carry the **Deep-blue vision window** into at least one meaningful focal area; reproduce its layer recipe rather than substituting a generic gradient.',
    'Reuse the same accent-to-neutral ratio, image treatment, corner language, and density so adjacent sections read as one system.',

    'Provide reduced-motion behavior and keyboard focus parity for every hover-driven reveal.',

    'Listing raw utility classes as a substitute for design intent.',
    'Applying the signature effect to every surface; protect a clear hierarchy and quiet reading areas.',
